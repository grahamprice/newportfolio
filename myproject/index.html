        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          Coming from a line of entrepreneurs, it didn't take me long to get my feet wet with a business of my own. In 2019 I started ClothesToHome, a service dedicated to providing all types of people with quality and affordable clothing. By the end of 2021, we had satisfied over 10,000 orders, and sold over 50,000 units.
           At the same time, I knew my pastures were far grander. That is when I started learning to code. In June 2022, I went to a Full Stack Engineer 15 week bootcamp at Flatiron Schools, in Denver. That completely changed my life. Now I am able to create full stack applications, and am able to learn anything that I want to do. 
        </p>

        <p>
          I love to travel, create, and enjoy life.

        <p>In going where you have to go, and doing what you have to do, and seeing what you have to see,
you dull and blunt the instrument you write with. But I would rather have it bent and dull and know I
had to put it on the grindstone again and hammer it into shape and put a whetstone to it, and know that
I had something to write about, than to have it bright and shining and nothing to say, or smooth and
well-oiled in the closet, but unused.

        <h3>Side Hustles</h3>
        <p>
          White Market Snacks-- In entrepreneurship in high school we were in charge of the school snack store, but because the government wants kids to be healthy and all, not a lot of kids were spending their hardearned money on apple crisps. So like any modern entrepreneur, I went to Costco. There I purchased variety boxes of chips, fruit roll ups, cookies, you name it. I simply doubled my price, and started chirping at the underclassmen that would pass by. Because of my low prices, I achieved many return customers and developed trust with my audience. But it all came crumbling down as I started advertising in the halls, I got hit with threats of lawsuit and cancellation of the entire school districts' free lunch program. White Market Snacks forever lives on in our hearts.

          Concrete Sealing -- Summers growing up, my father got me started in the business of sealing Concrete. We would go to peoples' houses and give their concrete driveways and patios the beauty treatment. Starting wih a sweep, then a powerwash we prepared the table for the main course. Along with a partner, we would apply a generous amount of weather-protectant sealing and shine that would last about two Colorado winters. This is essential for any decorative concrete to uphold its integrity. Unfortunately, due to the very dangerous chemicals used, I had to move on to something less detrimental to my health, although I miss those checks.
